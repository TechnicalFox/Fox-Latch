Fox-Latch
=========

Fox Latch is a web app built on Pyramid (Python) that is used to 
remotely lock and unlock doors using a servo. It also checks the 
state of the door and lock using the servo position and a hall 
effect sensor. These are connected to a Raspberry Pi and broadcast 
behind a security system: webauth.
